Our study is to compare the efficacy and characteristics of metallic foreign body (MFB) extraction from soft tissue by incision surgery and x-ray-guided forceps after body surface projection positioning.This study enrolled 775 patients who underwent percutaneous MFB extraction between January 2011 and December 2016. A total of 257 cases underwent extraction by incision surgery and 518 cases underwent x-ray-guided forceps extraction after body surface projection positioning.All patients were diagnosed by x-ray and the diagnostic accuracy rate was 100%. In the incision surgery group, MFB extraction was successful in 193 of 257 cases. All cases in the forceps extraction group were successful, and the success rate was significantly higher than that of the incision surgery group (100% vs.75.1%, P\u200a<\u200a.01). Sixty-four patients in the incision surgery group who failed treatment were subsequently treated with x-ray-guided forceps extraction and all MFBs were extracted. The symptoms in all patients were relieved, wound healing was good, and there were no major bleeding, incision infection, or other complications.Compared with incision surgery, x-ray-guided foreign body forceps extraction after body surface projection positioning is a less invasive, safer, and more effective treatment for MFB extraction.', 'Your browsing activity is empty.', 'Activity recording is turned off.', 'Turn recording back on']"

Methods: Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were used to reproduce HSs by making four full-thickness skin defect wounds with a diameter of 1 cm on the ventral surface of left ear of each rabbit. Wound epithelization and local-tissue proliferation were observed, and wound healing (complete epithelization) time and formation time of HS were recorded. The 24 rabbits were divided into SVF group, pure DMEM group, and pure HS group according to the random number table, with 8 rabbits and 32 wounds in each group. On post injury day (PID) 25 (after the complete epithelization of wounds), 0.2 mL of low glucose DMEM medium containing CM-Dil labeled autologous SVF was injected into HSs of rabbits in SVF group, while the same amount of low glucose DMEM medium was injected into HSs of rabbits in pure DMEM group. The frequency of injection was once every 5 days, totally for 3 times. HSs of rabbits in pure HS group did not receive any treatment. On PID 40, HSs of rabbits' ears in each group were harvested, then the histological form was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, the arrangement of collagen in HS was observed by Van Gieson staining, the distribution of CM-Dil-labeled SVF in the HS was observed with fluorescence microscope, and the mRNA expression and the protein expression of transforming growth factor β(1) (TGF-β(1)), Smad3, and Smad7 in HS were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test. Results: (1) Complete epithelization time of wounds of rabbits' ears was (20.0±2.0) d post injury, and HSs were formed on PID 25. On PID 40, HSs of rabbits' ears in pure DMEM group and pure HS group were still in hyperplasia, while those in SVF group became smaller, flat, soft, and light colored. (2) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group and pure HS group, the number of epithelium foot like structures was more and the amount of inflammatory cells was less. The collagen of HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group was arranged more regularly with broader gap between collagens. (3) On PID 40, CM-Dil-labeled SVF could still be observed in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group. (4) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group and pure HS group, the mRNA expressions of TGF-β(1) and Smad3 in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the mRNA expression of Smad7 was significantly up-regulated (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the mRNA expressions of TGF-β(1), Smad3, and Smad7 in the HSs of rabbits' ears between pure DMEM group and pure HS group (P>0.05). (5) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group (0.74±0.03, 0.73±0.10, 0.54±0.09) and pure HS group (0.72±0.08, 0.71±0.12, 0.53±0.06), the protein expressions of TGF-β(1) and Smad3 in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group (0.57±0.06, 0.42±0.09) were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the protein expression of Smad7 (0.71±0.05) was significantly up-regulated (P<0.05).

A common challenge for 3D bioprinting materials is that the structures printed from the biodegradable polymer hydrogels tend to collapse because of the poor mechanical stability. In this study, dual stimuli-responsive biodegradable polyurethane (PU) dispersions (PUA2 and PUA3) were synthesized from an eco-friendly waterborne process. Acrylate group was introduced in the PU chain end to serve as a photosensitive moiety for UV-induced cross-linking and improvement of the printability, while mixed oligodiols in the soft segment remained to be the thermosensitive moiety. The photo/thermal-induced morphological changes of PU nanoparticles were verified by dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and rheological measurement of the dispersions. It was observed that these PU nanoparticles became more rod-like in shape after UV treatment and formed compact packing structures upon further heating. With the thermosensitive properties, these UV-cured PU dispersions underwent rapid thermal gelation with gel moduli in the range 0.5-2 kPa near body temperature. The rheological properties of the PU hydrogels including dynamic viscoelasticity, creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior at 37 °C were favorable for processing by microextrusion-based 3D printing and could be easily mixed with cells before printing to produce cell-laden constructs. The dual-responsive hydrogel constructs demonstrated higher resolution and shape fidelity as well as better cell viability and proliferation than the thermoresponsive control. Moreover, the softer hydrogel (PUA3) with a low modulus (<1 kPa) could offer neural stem cells a tofu-like, stable, and inductive 3D microenvironment to proliferate and differentiate.

Methods: Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were used to reproduce HSs by making four full-thickness skin defect wounds with a diameter of 1 cm on the ventral surface of left ear of each rabbit. Wound epithelization and local-tissue proliferation were observed, and wound healing (complete epithelization) time and formation time of HS were recorded. The 24 rabbits were divided into SVF group, pure DMEM group, and pure HS group according to the random number table, with 8 rabbits and 32 wounds in each group. On post injury day (PID) 25 (after the complete epithelization of wounds), 0.2 mL of low glucose DMEM medium containing CM-Dil labeled autologous SVF was injected into HSs of rabbits in SVF group, while the same amount of low glucose DMEM medium was injected into HSs of rabbits in pure DMEM group. The frequency of injection was once every 5 days, totally for 3 times. HSs of rabbits in pure HS group did not receive any treatment. On PID 40, HSs of rabbits' ears in each group were harvested, then the histological form was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, the arrangement of collagen in HS was observed by Van Gieson staining, the distribution of CM-Dil-labeled SVF in the HS was observed with fluorescence microscope, and the mRNA expression and the protein expression of transforming growth factor β(1) (TGF-β(1)), Smad3, and Smad7 in HS were determined by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance and Tukey test. Results: (1) Complete epithelization time of wounds of rabbits' ears was (20.0±2.0) d post injury, and HSs were formed on PID 25. On PID 40, HSs of rabbits' ears in pure DMEM group and pure HS group were still in hyperplasia, while those in SVF group became smaller, flat, soft, and light colored. (2) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group and pure HS group, the number of epithelium foot like structures was more and the amount of inflammatory cells was less. The collagen of HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group was arranged more regularly with broader gap between collagens. (3) On PID 40, CM-Dil-labeled SVF could still be observed in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group. (4) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group and pure HS group, the mRNA expressions of TGF-β(1) and Smad3 in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the mRNA expression of Smad7 was significantly up-regulated (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in the mRNA expressions of TGF-β(1), Smad3, and Smad7 in the HSs of rabbits' ears between pure DMEM group and pure HS group (P>0.05). (5) On PID 40, compared with those in pure DMEM group (0.74±0.03, 0.73±0.10, 0.54±0.09) and pure HS group (0.72±0.08, 0.71±0.12, 0.53±0.06), the protein expressions of TGF-β(1) and Smad3 in the HSs of rabbits' ears in SVF group (0.57±0.06, 0.42±0.09) were significantly down-regulated (P<0.05), while the protein expression of Smad7 (0.71±0.05) was significantly up-regulated (P<0.05).

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30138272,"['It is well accepted that the use of mesh has facilitated and improved outcomes following repair of the complex abdominal hernias. Current mesh options include biologic, synthetic, and resorbable materials. The use of biologic materials for the repair and reinforcement of abdominal wall hernia has generated significant discussion. There are a variety of biologic mesh materials that are currently available that are derived from various sources including human, porcine, or bovine. All are processed for heterogeneous use, include variable amounts of collagen and elastin, and may or may not be crosslinked. The mechanism of action for biologic mesh is the incorporation, revascularization, and recellularization into the surrounding soft tissue. The presumed benefit is that the added soft-tissue support will reduce the incidence of surgical-site occurrences including recurrence. This article will review the salient studies that have incorporated biologic materials for the repair of complex abdominal hernia.']"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30133249,"['Three-dimensional bioprinting serves as an attractive platform to fabricate customized tissue-engineered substitutes from biomaterials and cells for the repair or replacement of injured tissues and organs. A common challenge for 3D bioprinting materials is that the structures printed from the biodegradable polymer hydrogels tend to collapse because of the poor mechanical stability. In this study, dual stimuli-responsive biodegradable polyurethane (PU) dispersions (PUA2 and PUA3) were synthesized from an eco-friendly waterborne process. Acrylate group was introduced in the PU chain end to serve as a photosensitive moiety for UV-induced cross-linking and improvement of the printability, while mixed oligodiols in the soft segment remained to be the thermosensitive moiety. The photo/thermal-induced morphological changes of PU nanoparticles were verified by dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and rheological measurement of the dispersions. It was observed that these PU nanoparticles became more rod-like in shape after UV treatment and formed compact packing structures upon further heating. With the thermosensitive properties, these UV-cured PU dispersions underwent rapid thermal gelation with gel moduli in the range 0.5-2 kPa near body temperature. The rheological properties of the PU hydrogels including dynamic viscoelasticity, creep recovery, and shear thinning behavior at 37 °C were favorable for processing by microextrusion-based 3D printing and could be easily mixed with cells before printing to produce cell-laden constructs. The dual-responsive hydrogel constructs demonstrated higher resolution and shape fidelity as well as better cell viability and proliferation than the thermoresponsive control. Moreover, the softer hydrogel (PUA3) with a low modulus (<1 kPa) could offer neural stem cells a tofu-like, stable, and inductive 3D microenvironment to proliferate and differentiate. We expect that the photo/thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane ink may offer unique rheological properties to contribute toward the custom-made bioprinting of soft tissues.', '3D bioprinting; biodegradable polyurethane; creep; dual stimuli-responsiveness; soft hydrogel']"
