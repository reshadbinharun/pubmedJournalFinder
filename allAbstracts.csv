In this preclinical study we illustrate the applicability of methylglyoxal in formulating an optimally designed combination regimen with chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer. Results demonstrated a synergistic augmentation in doxorubicin and cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 & MCF 7 with methylglyoxal co-treatment at metronomic concentrations. The cell death due to combination treatment was significantly prevented by N-Acetylcysteine and the synergistic effects were attenuated in presence of inhibitors for apoptosis and necroptosis, in MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 cells, respectively. Additionally, acridine orange staining and immunoblotting with LC3B antibody indicated the suppression of doxorubicin induced autophagy flux with methylglyoxal co-treatment. This report documents for the first time the preferential targeting of breast cancer stem cells by methylglyoxal. Combination treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin hindered mammosphere forming efficiency and inclusively eliminated both cancer stem as well as non-stem cancer cells. The synergistic effect was validated in Ehrlich mammary carcinoma cell induced murine ascites model and the combination advantage in vivo was achieved without any additional deleterious effect to liver and kidney.

Bone marrow‑derived cells (BMDCs) have been found to play a pivotal role in tumor growth. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are also found on certain subtypes of BMDCs, in addition to endothelial cells (ECs) and certain tumor cells. However, the role of BMDCs in E2‑induced tumor biology is still unclear. Thus, the effects of E2 on ER‑negative 4T1 breast cancer growth, the mobilization and recruitment of BMDCs, and interactions among BMDCs, ECs, and 4T1 cells were investigated. The results showed that E2 potentiated 4T1 tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy (OVX), or OVX and E2 replacement treatment. E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

The control group consisted of 527 patients without breast cancer from the same time period. Prior mammograms from these patients made up the control group [1054 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed for pixel-wise breast cancer risk prediction. Briefly, each mammogram was normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of 256\u202f×\u202f256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3\u202f×\u202f3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutions instead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases were separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with NVIDIA GTX 1070 Pascal GPU.', 'The average age of patients between the case and the control groups was not statistically different [case: 57.4 years (SD, 10.4) and control: 58.2 years (SD, 10.9), p\u202f=\u202f0.33]. Breast Density (BD) was significantly higher in the case group [2.39 (SD, 0.7)] than the control group [1.98 (SD, 0.75), p < 0.0001]. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, both CNN pixel-wise mammographic risk model and BD were significant independent predictors of breast cancer risk (p < 0.0001). The CNN risk model showed greater predictive potential [OR\u202f=\u202f4.42 (95% CI, 3.4-5.7] compared to BD [OR\u202f=\u202f1.67 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9).

Results demonstrated a synergistic augmentation in doxorubicin and cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 & MCF 7 with methylglyoxal co-treatment at metronomic concentrations. The cell death due to combination treatment was significantly prevented by N-Acetylcysteine and the synergistic effects were attenuated in presence of inhibitors for apoptosis and necroptosis, in MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 cells, respectively. Additionally, acridine orange staining and immunoblotting with LC3B antibody indicated the suppression of doxorubicin induced autophagy flux with methylglyoxal co-treatment. This report documents for the first time the preferential targeting of breast cancer stem cells by methylglyoxal. Combination treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin hindered mammosphere forming efficiency and inclusively eliminated both cancer stem as well as non-stem cancer cells. The synergistic effect was validated in Ehrlich mammary carcinoma cell induced murine ascites model and the combination advantage in vivo was achieved without any additional deleterious effect to liver and kidney.

Bone marrow‑derived cells (BMDCs) have been found to play a pivotal role in tumor growth. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are also found on certain subtypes of BMDCs, in addition to endothelial cells (ECs) and certain tumor cells. However, the role of BMDCs in E2‑induced tumor biology is still unclear. Thus, the effects of E2 on ER‑negative 4T1 breast cancer growth, the mobilization and recruitment of BMDCs, and interactions among BMDCs, ECs, and 4T1 cells were investigated. The results showed that E2 potentiated 4T1 tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy (OVX), or OVX and E2 replacement treatment. E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

First, 210 patients with new incidence of breast cancer were identified. Mammograms from these patients prior to developing breast cancer were identified and made up the case group [420 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. The control group consisted of 527 patients without breast cancer from the same time period. Prior mammograms from these patients made up the control group [1054 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed for pixel-wise breast cancer risk prediction. Briefly, each mammogram was normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of 256\u202f×\u202f256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3\u202f×\u202f3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutions instead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases were separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed.

In this preclinical study we illustrate the applicability of methylglyoxal in formulating an optimally designed combination regimen with chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer. Results demonstrated a synergistic augmentation in doxorubicin and cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 & MCF 7 with methylglyoxal co-treatment at metronomic concentrations. The cell death due to combination treatment was significantly prevented by N-Acetylcysteine and the synergistic effects were attenuated in presence of inhibitors for apoptosis and necroptosis, in MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 cells, respectively. Additionally, acridine orange staining and immunoblotting with LC3B antibody indicated the suppression of doxorubicin induced autophagy flux with methylglyoxal co-treatment. This report documents for the first time the preferential targeting of breast cancer stem cells by methylglyoxal. Combination treatment with doxorubicin or cisplatin hindered mammosphere forming efficiency and inclusively eliminated both cancer stem as well as non-stem cancer cells. The synergistic effect was validated in Ehrlich mammary carcinoma cell induced murine ascites model and the combination advantage in vivo was achieved without any additional deleterious effect to liver and kidney.

Bone marrow‑derived cells (BMDCs) have been found to play a pivotal role in tumor growth. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are also found on certain subtypes of BMDCs, in addition to endothelial cells (ECs) and certain tumor cells. However, the role of BMDCs in E2‑induced tumor biology is still unclear. Thus, the effects of E2 on ER‑negative 4T1 breast cancer growth, the mobilization and recruitment of BMDCs, and interactions among BMDCs, ECs, and 4T1 cells were investigated. The results showed that E2 potentiated 4T1 tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy (OVX), or OVX and E2 replacement treatment. E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

Nevertheless, breast prosthesis implantation brings a lot of complications, such as: postoperative chronic pain, capsule contracture, prosthesis displacement and prosthesis rupture and infection in severe cases. From the year 1998, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A), a neurotoxin, has been reported to be effective for pain control, capsule contracture lessening, expander enlargement and so on. However, those articles included all kinds of study types: randomized, double-blinded controlled trial (RCT), nonrandomized trial, retrospective analysis and case series, besides the outcomes were varied. To clarify how BTX-A acts at the mammaplasty field, we made this systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'To review how BTX-A acts in the field of mammaplasty as well as discuss the relative mechanisms of BTX-A and the related research progress.', 'We searched Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of science, Clinical trials, Wanfang Database and VIP from inception until March 2018 for papers reporting the use of BTX-A in the breast surgery using implants deep within the pectoralis major muscle. System review, viewpoints and case reports were excluded.', 'Ten articles met the criteria for inclusion including six prospective controlled (2 RCT; 4 other trails), three retrospective cohorts and one case series. These studies were all about patients using BTX-A during or after breast surgery with expanders or prostheses. A total of 682 patients were enrolled, 543 (79.61%) accepted BTX-A injection, 185 underwent mastectomies with immediate reconstruction, 13 with delayed reconstruction, 295 mastectomies with either immediate or delayed reconstruction and 189 with breast augmentation using silicone prostheses. The study time ranging from 4 months to 13 years, 15 patients (2.76%) received BTX-A injection more than two times, 9.2% received less than 75 U BTX-A, 34.3% 75-100 U, 0.18% 250 U, and in 56.4% the dosage was not stated. No complications associated with BTX-A were mentioned, almost all the studies reported efficacy for pain control. Other assessments included increased speed of expander enlargement and volume were mentioned in four papers, two articles analyzed the visual analogue scores, three suggested relief of capsular contracture, two reported lower narcotic use, three mentioned shorter hospital stays and one proved lowering the rate of unplanned expander. It seems all the studies demonstrate the valid usage of BTX-A, but the quality of this evidence still under the line.', 'We could try to use BTX-A as a new method in the field of mammaplasty. There are so many advantages such as postoperative pain relief, reducing the hospital stay, and increasing operation success rate, but rigorous methodological evidence is still lacking.

Briefly, each mammogram was normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of 256\u202f×\u202f256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3\u202f×\u202f3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutions instead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases were separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed.

In this preclinical study we illustrate the applicability of methylglyoxal in formulating an optimally designed combination regimen with chemotherapeutic drugs against breast cancer. Results demonstrated a synergistic augmentation in doxorubicin and cisplatin mediated cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 & MCF 7 with methylglyoxal co-treatment at metronomic concentrations. The cell death due to combination treatment was significantly prevented by N-Acetylcysteine and the synergistic effects were attenuated in presence of inhibitors for apoptosis and necroptosis, in MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 cells, respectively. Additionally, acridine orange staining and immunoblotting with LC3B antibody indicated the suppression of doxorubicin induced autophagy flux with methylglyoxal co-treatment. This report documents for the first time the preferential targeting of breast cancer stem cells by methylglyoxal.

Bone marrow‑derived cells (BMDCs) have been found to play a pivotal role in tumor growth. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are also found on certain subtypes of BMDCs, in addition to endothelial cells (ECs) and certain tumor cells. However, the role of BMDCs in E2‑induced tumor biology is still unclear. Thus, the effects of E2 on ER‑negative 4T1 breast cancer growth, the mobilization and recruitment of BMDCs, and interactions among BMDCs, ECs, and 4T1 cells were investigated. The results showed that E2 potentiated 4T1 tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy (OVX), or OVX and E2 replacement treatment. E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

As such, unilateral prosthetic reconstruction often requires a contralateral symmetry procedure (CSP). There is sparse literature on the impact of CSPs on long-term patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aims to describe PROs following CSPs, using a validated PRO tool, BREAST-Q. The hypothesis is that CSPs are associated with greater patient-reported satisfaction and HRQoL.', 'This study is a single institutional analysis of prospectively collected BREAST-Q scores of patients who underwent unilateral prosthetic BR during 2011 to 2015. Women 18 years and older with BREAST-Q scores measured ≥ 9months after BR with or without CSP(s) at the time of expander replacement were included. Patients were classified into four subcohorts: augmentation, mastopexy, reduction, and no symmetry procedure (controls). Sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and BREAST-Q scores were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression was performed.', 'Of 553 patients, 67 (12%) underwent contralateral augmentation, 68 (12%) mastopexy, 93(17%) reduction, and 325 (59%) were controls. Mean follow-up time was 52 months. Satisfaction with breast and outcomes were higher in the augmentation compared with the control groups (p\u2009=\u20090.01). On multivariable analysis, augmentation remained an independent predictor of satisfaction with breast (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Physical well-being scores were lower for contralateral mastopexy and reduction compared with the controls with a trend toward statistical significance on multivariable models. Psychological and sexual well-being was similar across groups.', 'Prosthetic reconstruction with contralateral breast augmentation was associated with greater satisfaction with breast and reconstructive outcome. In contrast, breast reduction and mastopexy procedures demonstrated equivalent satisfaction with breasts compared with controls but may be associated with lower physical well-being.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30106454,"['Estradiol (E2) is a prime culprit for enhancing the progression of female hormone‑related cancers. Bone marrow‑derived cells (BMDCs) have been found to play a pivotal role in tumor growth. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are also found on certain subtypes of BMDCs, in addition to endothelial cells (ECs) and certain tumor cells. However, the role of BMDCs in E2‑induced tumor biology is still unclear. Thus, the effects of E2 on ER‑negative 4T1 breast cancer growth, the mobilization and recruitment of BMDCs, and interactions among BMDCs, ECs, and 4T1 cells were investigated. The results showed that E2 potentiated 4T1 tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice subjected to sham operation, ovariectomy (OVX), or OVX and E2 replacement treatment. E2 supplementation in mice with OVX upregulated the transcription of stromal cell‑derived factor‑1 (SDF‑1) mRNA in tumor tissues and enhanced the recruitment of BMDCs into tumor tissues in vivo. E2 deficiency significantly decreased proangiogenic CXCR4+, β3+, Sca‑1+ and CXCR4+β3+ BMDCs circulating in the peripheral blood. Cell‑based system analyses showed that E2 augmented the transcription of β3 mRNA in ECs, increased the adhesion of BMDCs to ECs. In addition, E2 enhanced the BMDC‑induced EC proliferation and migration, the BMDC‑induced 4T1 proliferation and the 4T1‑stimulated EC proliferation in addition to enhancing the proliferation of tumor cells and the migration of ECs in vitro. Therefore, E2 enhanced the growth of breast tumors by stimulating tumor cells and ECs directly, as well as by increasing proangiogenic BMDC mobilization and recruitment leading to augmentation of the tumor and EC functions indirectly by cell proliferation assay. These findings reveal a separate mechanism via which E2 promotes the growth of female hormone‑dependent tumors, which may be useful in explorations of new therapies for related cancers.']"

As such, unilateral prosthetic reconstruction often requires a contralateral symmetry procedure (CSP). There is sparse literature on the impact of CSPs on long-term patient-reported outcomes (PROs) such as satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study aims to describe PROs following CSPs, using a validated PRO tool, BREAST-Q. The hypothesis is that CSPs are associated with greater patient-reported satisfaction and HRQoL.', 'This study is a single institutional analysis of prospectively collected BREAST-Q scores of patients who underwent unilateral prosthetic BR during 2011 to 2015. Women 18 years and older with BREAST-Q scores measured ≥ 9months after BR with or without CSP(s) at the time of expander replacement were included. Patients were classified into four subcohorts: augmentation, mastopexy, reduction, and no symmetry procedure (controls). Sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and BREAST-Q scores were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression was performed.', 'Of 553 patients, 67 (12%) underwent contralateral augmentation, 68 (12%) mastopexy, 93(17%) reduction, and 325 (59%) were controls. Mean follow-up time was 52 months. Satisfaction with breast and outcomes were higher in the augmentation compared with the control groups (p\u2009=\u20090.01). On multivariable analysis, augmentation remained an independent predictor of satisfaction with breast (p\u2009=\u20090.04). Physical well-being scores were lower for contralateral mastopexy and reduction compared with the controls with a trend toward statistical significance on multivariable models. Psychological and sexual well-being was similar across groups.', 'Prosthetic reconstruction with contralateral breast augmentation was associated with greater satisfaction with breast and reconstructive outcome. In contrast, breast reduction and mastopexy procedures demonstrated equivalent satisfaction with breasts compared with controls but may be associated with lower physical well-being. Such information can be used to improve the shared decision-making process for women who choose unilateral prosthetic BR.', 'Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.']"

With the increasing demand for aesthetics, these silicon implants were not only used in breast augmentation surgery but also in breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Nevertheless, breast prosthesis implantation brings a lot of complications, such as: postoperative chronic pain, capsule contracture, prosthesis displacement and prosthesis rupture and infection in severe cases. From the year 1998, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A), a neurotoxin, has been reported to be effective for pain control, capsule contracture lessening, expander enlargement and so on. However, those articles included all kinds of study types: randomized, double-blinded controlled trial (RCT), nonrandomized trial, retrospective analysis and case series, besides the outcomes were varied. To clarify how BTX-A acts at the mammaplasty field, we made this systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'To review how BTX-A acts in the field of mammaplasty as well as discuss the relative mechanisms of BTX-A and the related research progress.', 'We searched Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of science, Clinical trials, Wanfang Database and VIP from inception until March 2018 for papers reporting the use of BTX-A in the breast surgery using implants deep within the pectoralis major muscle. System review, viewpoints and case reports were excluded.', 'Ten articles met the criteria for inclusion including six prospective controlled (2 RCT; 4 other trails), three retrospective cohorts and one case series. These studies were all about patients using BTX-A during or after breast surgery with expanders or prostheses. A total of 682 patients were enrolled, 543 (79.61%) accepted BTX-A injection, 185 underwent mastectomies with immediate reconstruction, 13 with delayed reconstruction, 295 mastectomies with either immediate or delayed reconstruction and 189 with breast augmentation using silicone prostheses. The study time ranging from 4 months to 13 years, 15 patients (2.76%) received BTX-A injection more than two times, 9.2% received less than 75 U BTX-A, 34.3% 75-100 U, 0.18% 250 U, and in 56.4% the dosage was not stated. No complications associated with BTX-A were mentioned, almost all the studies reported efficacy for pain control. Other assessments included increased speed of expander enlargement and volume were mentioned in four papers, two articles analyzed the visual analogue scores, three suggested relief of capsular contracture, two reported lower narcotic use, three mentioned shorter hospital stays and one proved lowering the rate of unplanned expander. It seems all the studies demonstrate the valid usage of BTX-A, but the quality of this evidence still under the line.', 'We could try to use BTX-A as a new method in the field of mammaplasty. There are so many advantages such as postoperative pain relief, reducing the hospital stay, and increasing operation success rate, but rigorous methodological evidence is still lacking.

First, 210 patients with new incidence of breast cancer were identified. Mammograms from these patients prior to developing breast cancer were identified and made up the case group [420 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. The control group consisted of 527 patients without breast cancer from the same time period. Prior mammograms from these patients made up the control group [1054 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed for pixel-wise breast cancer risk prediction. Briefly, each mammogram was normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of 256\u202f×\u202f256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3\u202f×\u202f3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutions instead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases were separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with NVIDIA GTX 1070 Pascal GPU.', 'The average age of patients between the case and the control groups was not statistically different [case: 57.4 years (SD, 10.4) and control: 58.2 years (SD, 10.9), p\u202f=\u202f0.33].
